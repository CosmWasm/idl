# CosmWasm IDL v1.0.0

The CosmWasm IDL (Interface Description Language) is a format for describing the
interface of a smart contract, meant to be consumed by generic clients. This
allows those clients to interact with CosmWasm contracts without prior contract,
much like a web browser is able to interact with any website without priot
knowledge of it.

If you have a smart contract generated from the usual
[template](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template), you should be able to get
an IDL file for it by simply running `cosmwasm schema`.

An example consumer of these files is
[`ts-codegen`](https://github.com/CosmWasm/ts-codegen).

Currently, the IDL format uses [JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org/) heavily
for defining messages and their responses, but provides some metadata and
structure to tie them together.

## An example

The following is an overview with the JSON schemas removed. The full file can be
found
[here](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/blob/ef5e8558ef047b25544d794a302f181809d79195/contracts/hackatom/schema/hackatom.json).

```json
{
  "contract_name": "hackatom",
  "contract_version": "0.0.0",
  "idl_version": "1.0.0",
  "instantiate": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_INSTANTIATE*,
  "execute": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_EXECUTE*,
  "query": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_QUERY*,
  "migrate": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_MIGRATE*,
  "sudo": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_SUDO*,
  "responses": {
    "get_int": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_RESPONSE_TO_GET_INT_QUERY*,
    "other_balance": *JSON_SCHEMA_FOR_RESPONSE_TO_OTHER_BALANCE_QUERY*,
  },
}
```
